This project involves analyzing student performance data to understand the relationship between the time spent on questions and their correctness. It includes steps such as loading data, examining basic statistics, visualizing the distribution of time spent, calculating the correlation between time and correctness.

Outline Project Overview and Objectives: Draft the 'Project Overview and Objectives' section of the blog post, summarizing what the project does and its goals based on the current notebook's analysis of student performance data.
Detail Basic Theory and Prerequisites: Write the 'Basic Theory and Prerequisites' section, explaining the core concepts used (e.g., data loading with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, correlation, basic conditional logic) and any setup needed to replicate the project.
Explain Motivation and Real-World Relevance: Develop the 'Motivation and Real-world Relevance' section, discussing why analyzing time spent versus correctness is important in educational contexts, and where such insights could be applied.
Provide Step-by-Step Implementation Explanation: Elaborate on the 'Step-by-step explanation of the implementation'. This will involve going through the provided Python code line-by-line, explaining what each part does, how it processes the data, and its contribution to the overall analysis.
Final Task: Compile all sections into a cohesive blog post suitable for Medium.com, ensuring a clear flow, technical accuracy, and an engaging narrative.
